# show-randomizer
Get random shows or episodes of selected shows.

## How To Use
1. Fill the data file in the manner described by the first line of the example data file.
2. `$ python3 show.py <search term>`
where `<search term>` is either 'show' to get a random show from the data file, or it is 'name of show' in the data file.

## The Program cannot find my data file.  What should I do?
Make sure the file has the same name and format as the example file, and make sure the actual data in the file appears in the same order and with the same separators as the example file (commas and symbols matter here!)
